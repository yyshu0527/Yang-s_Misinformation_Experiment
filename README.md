## README

The present file consists the behavioral and EEG data collected in the experiment of misinformation processing.

The file of "rating.csv" is the rating scores (averaged across trials for each condition within every participants) on the perceived truth of all misinformation.

The file named "cw1/2/3_rt.csv" recorded the reaction times (averaged across trials for each condition within every participants) of the first/second/third Critical words under the conditions of m1(UF+G),m4(F+G),m3(UF+B),m4(F+B) from 16 participants.

The file named "1_16data.mat" contained the 4 dimensioned time-series data (averaged across trials for each condition within every participants) in the form of participants*conditions * channels * time points, wherein, the 1st condition refers to the first critical word in the UF+G sentence, the 2nd condition is the second critical word of the UF+G sentence, the 3rd one is in the third crtical word in the UF+G word, the 4th represents the first critical word in the F+G sentence, the 5th condition is the second critical word of the F+G sentence. The following also conditions go throng  the same order. There are 12 conditons which contain 3 critical words appearing in 4 conditions in total.

The file of "stimuli.csv" documented all the stimuli in Chinese. 

The files of "pilot_ratingF/UF/G/B.csv" recond the ratings of familarity and the benifical degrees of all stimulus candidates in our pilot study.
