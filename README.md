## README

The present file folder consists of the behavioral and EEG data collected in the misinformation comprehension and truth validation task developed by Yishu Yang and Min Zhang.

The file of "rating.csv" reports the rating scores (averaged across trials for each condition within every participants) of the perceived truth about misinformation stimuli.

The files named "cw1/2/3_rt.csv" record the reaction times (averaged across trials for each condition within every participants) of the first/second/third critical words under the conditions of m1(UF+G),m4(F+G),m3(UF+B),m4(F+B) from 16 participants.

The file named "1_16data.mat" contains a 4 dimensioned time-series dataset (averaged across trials for each condition within every participants) in the format of participants*conditions * channels * time points, wherein, the 1st condition refers to the first critical word embedded in the UF+G sentence, the 2nd condition is the second critical word of the UF+G sentence, the 3rd one is in the third critical word in the UF+G word, the 4th represents the first critical word in the F+G sentence, and the 5th condition is the second critical word of the F+G sentence. The next 7 conditions also follow the same order. There are 12 conditions in total which contain 3 critical words and every critical word appears in the mentioned 4 conditions.

The file of "stimuli.csv" documented all the stimuli in Chinese. 

The files of "pilot_ratingF/UF/G/B.csv" record the ratings of familarity and the benifical degrees of all stimulus candidates in our pilot study.
